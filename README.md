VitalMine - AI-Powered Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)Semester 8 Major Project | IMCA (AI Specialization)Student: Om Tejaskumar Bhatt🏥 Project OverviewVitalMine is a next-generation Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) designed to bridge the gap between IoT Real-Time Monitoring and Generative AI Medical Analysis.Unlike traditional hospital management systems that only store data, VitalMine actively monitors patient vitals using a Simulated IoT Wearable Layer. It processes this data through a Hybrid Intelligence Engine—combining deterministic clinical rules for immediate sepsis alerts with Google Gemini 1.5 (GenAI) for complex, context-aware medical consultation.The system features strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), ensuring that Doctors, Nurses, and Patients interact with the system securely and appropriately.🚀 Key Features🧠 1. Generative AI Medical Assistant (Gemini 1.5)Context-Aware Chatbot: The AI doesn't just answer general questions; it "reads" the specific patient's live chart.Active Monitoring: If a patient's status is "High Risk," the AI proactively warns the user before answering their query.Self-Repairing Connection: Automatically detects and switches between available AI models (gemini-1.5-flash vs gemini-pro) to prevent downtime.📡 2. IoT Sepsis SimulatorReal-Time Data Streaming: Includes a standalone script (wearable_device.py) that acts as a physical patient monitor.Simulation Modes:Mode 1: Healthy/Recovery (Normal vitals).Mode 2: Sepsis Onset (Spiking fever >39°C, Tachycardia >100bpm).Mode 3: Hypothermia/Shock (Low temp, rapid/weak pulse).🔒 3. Enterprise-Grade SecurityRole-Based Access Control (RBAC):Doctors: Full clinical oversight, PDF generation, AI consultation.Nurses: Rapid vitals entry, ward monitoring.Patients: Read-only access to personal history and AI advice.Secure Authentication: Password visibility toggles and session management.📄 4. Clinical DocumentationAutomated PDF Reports: Generates professional discharge summaries and status reports using ReportLab.CSV Data Export: Allows administrators to export ward data for external auditing.🛠️ Tech StackCore Framework: Python 3.10+, FlaskArtificial Intelligence: Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash), Scikit-LearnIoT Simulation: Python Threading & HTTP RequestsDatabase: SQLite (SQLAlchemy ORM)Reporting: ReportLab (PDF), CSVFrontend: Bootstrap 5, Jinja2, FontAwesome, JavaScript⚙️ Installation & Setup1.
